# better-run-start

better-run-start is a mod for *[Binding of Isaac: Repentance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426300/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance/)*, written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using the [IsaacScript](https://isaacscript.github.io/) framework.

# What does it do?

Currently the mod rerolls all items of [quality](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Item_Quality) lower than 2, for the first floor item room, on normal/hard mode

# What's coming next?

- Check if the mod works properly with Tainted Isaac and if it doesn't fix it

- Make it so the Greed/Greedier mode first item room also rerolls low quality items

- Let user configure the quality threshold 

# What's also potentially coming if i'm not lazy

- Make it so the first Greed/Greedier item room is always opened (or drop a key at the start of those modes)

- Make it so you start each of your run in the item room
